### What is it? ###
A couple of powershell scripts and a curl.exe

### What does it do? ###
Helps you upload, install, and publish `.update` files to a Sitecore instance from Powershell

### What do I need it for? ###
I stumbled across the inital premise for these scripts somewhere online (they are not originally mine). I needed a way for a VSTS (TFS+RM) release to upload and trigger a publish of an update package.

### How do I use it ###
Should be as easy as:

1. Clone, download, whatever, just get these files into your project

1. Execute the scripts with the necessary params provided.
